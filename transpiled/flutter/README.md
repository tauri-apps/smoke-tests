A basic 2048 game written with Flutter and transpiled for the web.

To run, get the flutter sdk and execute `flutter build web`.  If you want to just build and serve the flutter app via a chrome you can run `flutter run -d chrome`.  To run on the experimental webserver, use `flutter run -d web-server`.
